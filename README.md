# Building an AI Agent using Agentic AI

## Overview

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and act autonomously to achieve a goal. This project demonstrates how to build an AI Agent for trading using Agentic AI with Python, leveraging Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for decision-making in stock market trading.

## Project Components

This project involves several key components fundamental to Agentic AI:

The Agent: A decision-making entity (DQN trading agent) responsible for making trading decisions based on market data.

The Environment: A trading environment consisting of stock market data where the agent interacts with price movements and executes trades.

The State: Information available to the agent at any given time (e.g., stock closing price, moving averages, daily returns).

The Action Space: The set of actions the agent can take (Buy, Sell, Hold).

The Reward Function: A function that evaluates the agentâ€™s performance, aiming to maximize total profit by the end of the trading session.

## Features

âœ… Implementation of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for decision-makingâœ… Integration with Yahoo Finance API for real-time stock market dataâœ… Reinforcement learning-based optimization for improving trading strategiesâœ… Performance evaluation using cumulative rewards and profit analysisâœ… Modular and extensible architecture for future improvements

Technologies Used

Python (Primary programming language)

TensorFlow / PyTorch (Deep learning framework)

Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation and analysis)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data visualization)

Yahoo Finance API (Stock market data retrieval)

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Agent-For-Treding.git
cd your-repository
```

## Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Install required dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Future Enhancements

Implement multi-agent reinforcement learning for better decision-making

Optimize reward functions to improve trading performance

Extend support for multiple stock market datasets

Develop a real-time trading bot with live market data
